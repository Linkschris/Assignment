    "- $\\frac{L_c}{L} - \\left( \\frac{k_c}{2L} \\right)^2$: This difference measures how the actual fraction of links within the community compares to the expected fraction under a random distribution. A positive value indicates that there are more links within the community than expected by chance, suggesting a meaningful community structure.\n",

It then examines each node's neighbors to determine if moving that node to a neighboring community would increase the modularity. This process is repeated for all nodes until no such move can improve the modularity.  \n",
    "2. Aggregation: Once the local optimization phase is completed, the algorithm treats each identified community as a \"super-node\" and aggregates them. Links between nodes in the same community are transformed into self-loops on the corresponding super-node. Links between different communities result in weighted edges between the corresponding super-nodes. This aggregated network is then used as the input for the next round of the local optimization phase.  \n",

The fact that the modularity score is ~0.41 with 7 to 9 partitions indicates that while the heuristic has identified more granular communities, the separation between these communities isn't as strong (in terms of modularity) as the geographical east-west separation.\n",
